/*
 * Instance status for the operator panel (issue #274).
 *
 * Answers "how is this running instance ACTUALLY configured?" so #219's go-live
 * checklist can be verified from the app instead of by reading Railway's
 * env-var list and hoping. Every quiet misconfiguration it reports has the same
 * shape: the app keeps working, just not the way the operator believes —
 * ACCOUNTS_ENABLED set without a real SESSION_SECRET, a missing BREVO_API_KEY
 * sending verification mail to the in-memory outbox (lib/mail.js degrades by
 * design), S3_BUCKET unset so uploads land on an ephemeral container
 * filesystem, ADMIN_PASSWORD equal to AUTH_PASSWORD (a privilege escalation —
 * see lib/admin.js's header). None of these announce themselves.
 *
 * TWO RULES, both load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. NEVER return a secret — not in full, not truncated, not hashed-and-shown.
 *    Every field here is a derived boolean, an enum, a number, or a public host
 *    name. The panel is password-gated, not secret-cleared, and a screenshot of
 *    it must be harmless. Where two secrets are compared (see `distinct`
 *    below), only the verdict escapes.
 * 2. Read every value PER CALL, never at module load, so the answer describes
 *    the process as it is now and a test can drive it deterministically — the
 *    same reason lib/app.js reads its rate-limit ceilings and lib/admin.js its
 *    config per call (.claude/rules/security-middleware.md).
 *
 * Read-only by construction: there is no writer here and the panel offers no
 * editing. Env vars stay a deliberate Railway action.
