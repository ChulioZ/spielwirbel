/*
 * Data-access layer — PostgreSQL backend (issue #127; Knex since #211).
 *
 * Selected by ./index.js when DATABASE_URL is set. Implements the exact same
 * async contract as ./json.js (the documented shape lives there), so routes are
 * unchanged whichever backend runs. This is the stateless-app-tier persistence
 * the production roadmap needs (docs/production-readiness.md §3).
 *
 * Query building + schema migrations go through **Knex** (issue #211): the
 * fluent builder replaces the hand-written parameterized SQL (and its JSONB
 * footguns), and versioned migration files under ./migrations replace the old
 * inline `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` template re-run on every boot. The knex
 * instance is built from the shared ../../knexfile.js (same config the CLI uses).
 *
 * Storage shape — a table per top-level entity, one row each, with the "messy"
 * nested bits kept as JSONB (votes maps, gameIds/winnerIds arrays, activity
 * payloads, the design) exactly as the roadmap sanctions ("JSONB where that's
 * genuinely simpler, need not fully normalize on day one"):
 *   rounds(id, tenant_id, name, background jsonb, tags jsonb)
 *   members / games / sessions / activities (id, round_id -> rounds ON DELETE
 *   CASCADE, tenant_id, data jsonb)  — `data` holds every field except
 *   id/round_id.
 * `seq bigserial` preserves insertion order (arrays in the JSON model are
 * ordered).
 *
 * Tenancy (issue #136) — two independent layers, so a slip in one can't leak:
 *  1. App layer: every round-scoped method takes the tenant first and every
 *     statement filters/writes `tenant_id` explicitly (children carry it
 *     denormalized so a guessed round_id+child_id can't cross tenants).
 *  2. Row-Level Security: the round tables ENABLE + FORCE row level security
 *     with policies comparing tenant_id to the per-transaction setting
 *     `app.tenant_id`. Every tenant-scoped statement runs inside a transaction
 *     that sets it (tx/qt below). FORCE means even the table owner (the role
 *     Railway/CI connect as) is subject; `current_setting(..., true)` yields
 *     NULL when unset, so a query outside tx/qt sees NO rows — fail-closed,
 *     never fail-open.
 * The users table is NOT tenant-scoped: users are the identity layer (looked up
 * by email at login, before any tenant is known) and carry their tenantId in
 * `data` instead.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *  - Reads assemble plain objects fresh from the rows (like a DB snapshot), so a
 *    caller mutating a returned object never touches the store — same contract as
 *    the JSON backend.
 *  - Every value written to a JSONB column is passed through `J` (JSON.stringify),
 *    NOT as a raw JS value. Knex/pg serialize a plain object to JSON fine but turn
 *    a JS ARRAY into a Postgres array literal — corrupting `tags` (an array) and
 *    any array payload. Stringifying uniformly sidesteps the footgun; pg casts
 *    the text to jsonb on assignment.
 *  - JSONB reads come back already parsed (pg's jsonb parser -> JS objects).
 *  - Not-found -> `null`; never throws for it. SQL/connection errors do reject
 *    and reach the central error handler (Express 5 forwards them).

 * Single-round-trip read statements (issue #203). The hot reads (home screen,
 * round navigation, Chronik) used to issue one qt() PER TABLE — each a full
 * transaction: BEGIN + set_config + SELECT + COMMIT = 4 round trips on its own
 * pooled connection. Measured against a latency-injected Postgres, that put
 * ~9 round trips of wall time under GET /api/rounds and ~4.4 under
 * GET /api/rounds/:rid — the ~1s hosted round loads #203 was filed for.
 *
 * These statements collapse each read to ONE round trip on ONE connection:
 *
 *  - The materialized CTE `_t` calls set_config('app.tenant_id', ?, true),
 *    establishing the RLS tenant scope *inside the statement's own implicit
 *    transaction*; being transaction-local it dies at statement end, so nothing
 *    ever leaks to the next pooled checkout (same guarantee tx() gives).
 *  - Every subquery correlates on `_t.v` — set_config's RETURN VALUE (the
 *    tenant id). That is a real dataflow dependency, not an ordering hope: the
 *    executor must produce the `_t` row (running set_config) before it can
 *    evaluate any target-list subquery, so the RLS policies' current_setting()
 *    always sees the tenant during the scans. MATERIALIZED (plus set_config
 *    being volatile) keeps the CTE a separate, evaluate-first node.
 *  - The explicit `tenant_id = _t.v` predicates stay the app-layer half of the
 *    double enforcement (.claude/rules/tenancy-rls.md); RLS remains the
 *    backstop. If the evaluation-order guarantee ever broke, RLS would return
 *    ZERO rows (fail-closed, loud) — never cross-tenant data. The plain-role
 *    probe in test/repo.postgres.test.js runs these texts under FORCE RLS as a
 *    non-superuser to prove the ordering holds for real.
 *
 * Exported for exactly that test; don't rewrite these reads back onto qt() —
 * that reintroduces the round-trip amplification this fixed.
