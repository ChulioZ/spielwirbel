/* Spielwirbel – lookup grouping: collapse same-title provider hits into one row.

   (browser global) and as a CommonJS module the test suite can require. Load

// Group merged provider hits by normalized title (trim + lowercase, no
// fuzzy/edit-distance matching) into one row per game. Note this is
// deliberately *weaker* than scoreHit's fold (lookup-score.js), which also
// strips punctuation and diacritics: that fold decides how well a title
// answers the query, whereas this key decides whether two providers are
// offering the *same game*. Folding punctuation away here would merge titles
// that differ only by it into one row, which is a separate call from #317.
// Each hit carries { provider, title, thumbnail, score, prio,
// order } (prio = LOOKUP_PROVIDERS priority, order = the provider's own order).
//
// Returns an array of groups, each:
//   { key, title, thumbnail, primary, members }
// - members: one hit per contributing provider (the strongest per provider),
//   ordered by provider priority — one badge each.
// - primary: the highest-priority provider's hit (drives the row title/thumb and
//   the title-click pick).
// - title: the primary provider's display title (casing may differ per provider).
// - thumbnail: the highest-priority member that has a thumbnail (else null).
//
// Groups are ranked by their *best* member (max score, then best priority, then
// shortest title, then earliest order), so a game's row rank is its strongest
// provider's rank. When `max` is a number the result is sliced to that many
// groups (rows).

  // Shortest title breaks a tie that score and provider priority leave open
  // (#527). A companion SKU — a free "friend's pass", a soundtrack, an edition —
  // is its base game's title plus a qualifier, so at equal query relevance the
  // shorter title is the closer answer to what was typed. This is the same rule
  // parseSearch in lib/providers/bgg.js already applies *within* its own results
  // ("prefers the shorter title on a tie"), lifted to the cross-provider merge.
  //
  // Placed AFTER prio, which is what confines it: prio is the provider's index
  // in the active list, so two groups whose best members come from different
  // providers always differ there and never reach this term. It can therefore
  // only ever reorder two hits of the SAME provider — no provider's rows move
  // relative to another's.
  //
  // Why not the obvious PS Store signals — both measured live on 2026-07-31,
  // and both are why this is a title rule rather than a provider one:
  //   - `storeDisplayClassification` does not discriminate. For "It Takes Two"
  //     the game is GAME_BUNDLE and its two Freunde-Pässe are FULL_GAME, so
  //     preferring FULL_GAME ranks the passes FIRST; for "Split Fiction" the
  //     game and its pass are BOTH GAME_BUNDLE, so it separates nothing.
  //   - `price.isFree` is ruled out by
  //     .claude/rules/psstore-full-game-is-not-every-game.md — EA SPORTS FC 25's
  //     standard edition and every Fortnite entry report isFree: true, so it
  //     demotes exactly the free-to-play games it looks like it would rescue.
