A small, self-hosted web app for any group or gaming round to manage their board
and digital games, decide what to play in a session, and track how much everyone
liked each game. The user interface is available in **German and English**; the
code and documentation are in English.

> ⚠️ **Local use only — no authentication.** This app has intentionally **no
> login or access control**. Run it only on a trusted home network. Do not
> expose it to the public internet.

## Features

- **Rounds** – a group with a name and any number of members. The home screen
  is a lobby of round cards (members, game/session counts, last result); a new
  round is set up on a playful "seats around the table" screen, optionally
  importing the games list from an existing round.
- **Games** – each game has a title, type (analog / digital), an expected
  duration (short / medium / long), a required player range (min–max), and an
  optional cover image (paste from clipboard or pick a file). When adding a
  game, the title field doubles as a **search-as-you-type lookup against
  BoardGameGeek**: pick a suggestion to auto-fill the title, cover image,
  player range, type and duration, and store a link back to the game's BGG
  page (shown on its detail view). The lookup is optional — manual entry works
  exactly as before, and the app degrades gracefully when BGG is unreachable.
  Details can be edited inline on the game's detail page. Games are never lost
  by accident:
  instead of deleting, they are **retired** — kept with a timestamp in a
  browsable archive and restorable any time. Only already-retired games can be
  permanently deleted.
- **Members** – each member has a detail page (opened from the Start hero row,
  the Pokale podium, or a session's participant list) with their stats — wins,
  sessions joined, win rate, average rating given, and favorite game — and lets
  you rename them and pick their avatar color from the curated palette.
- **Round hub** – each round is a small app of its own, with a floating dock
  switching between four tabs:
  - **Start** – the launchpad: hero with the members, a big "start session"
    button, resumable in-progress sessions, the last played result, and gentle
    retire recommendations for games that are rated low or often proposed for
    retirement.
  - **Regal** (shelf) – the game collection as a card grid with filter chips
    (all / analog / digital), a search pill, sorting (random / name / rating),
    and the add-game sheet. Each card opens the game's detail page
    ("Spielepass") with its score ring, editable details, a **Jetzt spielen**
    launcher, and the history of sessions it appeared in.
  - **Chronik** – one month-grouped timeline of everything that happened:
    games added / retired / restored and session outcomes.
  - **Pokale** (trophies) – a winners' podium (ties share a step) plus stat
    tiles: most played, best rated, current winning streak, and the
    "Staubfänger" — the game gathering dust the longest.
- **Sessions (hot-seat voting)** – pick who is playing tonight, filter the
  collection by type and duration, and draw a random set of candidate games —
  only games whose player range fits the number of joining members are
  eligible. The device is then passed around: a handover screen names whose
  turn it is, and each member rates every drawn game **1–5** or proposes to
  retire it (member order is randomized).
- **Jetzt spielen** (play now) – when the group already knows what they want,
  launch a session for **one specific game** straight from its detail page or a
  Pokale tile: pick who joins and skip the vote entirely, landing directly on
  the results screen with that game chosen.
- **Finale & results** – votes stay sealed until everyone is done, then a
  little show reveals the results: per-game average (colored by score), rating
  distribution, medals for the favourites, and retirement proposals. Pick the
  game you actually played, mark it finished and record the winner(s) — or
  cancel the session if nothing appealed. Sessions can be deleted later, and a
  single game can be removed from a session's results.
- **Ratings on demand** – a game's average is always computed live from all
  session votes, so deleting a session automatically corrects every average.
- **Designs** – per round, pick a colour scheme (page tone + accent); the
  whole UI derives from it — surfaces, shadows, even the dark "stage" of the
  finale.
- **Languages** – German and English, following the system language by
  default, switchable any time via the picker in the top bar.
- **Shareable links & reload-safe navigation** – the URL reflects the current
  screen (home, a round tab, a game, a member, a session result, …), so a
  reload keeps you where you were and any stable view can be bookmarked or
  linked to. Browser Back/Forward move between visited views.

## Tech & architecture

- **Backend:** Node.js + [Express](https://expressjs.com/). No database — a
  single `data/data.json` file is the source of truth (loaded into memory,
  written atomically on every change). Cover images are stored as files under
  `data/uploads/`; only their paths live in `data.json`.
- **Frontend:** plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS under `public/` — **no build step**.
- **Runs entirely on your machine.** Fonts and the icon set are self-hosted
  under `public/fonts/`, and the subtle background grain is an inline SVG in the
  stylesheet — no CDNs. The one runtime external call is **opt-in**: the
  add-game lookup queries BoardGameGeek server-side (via `/api/lookup/*`) only
  when you type a title to search; it sends just the search text, and the app
  works fully without it.

  app.js             builds the Express app: static files + route modules,

                     routes so deep links / reloads work)

The frontend files are plain `<script>`s that share one global scope; **load
order matters** (see `index.html`).

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18 or newer.** If you don't have it, download the latest LTS
  installer from <https://nodejs.org/> and run it — that's the only prerequisite.
  (Developed and tested on Node 26.)

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start          # or: node server.js
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

From other devices on your home network: `http://<your-computer-ip>:3000`
(find the IP with e.g. `ipconfig getifaddr en0` on macOS).

Use a different port: `PORT=8080 npm start`
Use a different data folder: `DATA_DIR=/path/to/data npm start`

## Development

```bash
npm test              # automated tests (Node's built-in runner + supertest)
npm run lint          # ESLint (flat config)
npm run check:syntax  # node --check over all JS files
```

CI runs the test suite plus lint and syntax checks on every push and pull
request; Dependabot keeps dependencies updated via weekly PRs.

## Contributing

This project is built and maintained with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code),
and the repository ships the workflow with it: a set of **skills** in
`.claude/skills/` and **rules** in `.claude/rules/` that encode how work gets
done here. Whether you contribute by prompting Claude Code or by hand, these are
the intended path — start there rather than improvising.

### Before you start

- Read `CLAUDE.md` — it states the non-negotiables (local-only, no auth, no build
  step, no framework, no database; German UI, English code) and the architecture
  you must work within.
- Skim `.claude/rules/` — one short file per hard-won gotcha (frontend script
  load order, the shared-global-scope lint setup, theme-derived colours, why you
  must never read the production `data/` folder, …). When you touch an area a
  rule covers, follow it. Found a new gotcha? Add a rule file for it.

### The skill workflow

The skills chain into a backlog-to-merge pipeline. Invoke a skill in Claude Code
by name (e.g. `/implement`), or just describe the task and let the matching skill
trigger. Each is self-contained and enforces this repo's constraints.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **`create-issue`** | Interviews you and files a GitHub issue specific enough to implement without follow-up questions, grounded in this repo's architecture. |
| **`pick-issue`** | Surveys open issues (and pending Dependabot PRs), ranks them by value-for-effort, and hands the best next one to the right builder skill. |
| **`implement`** | Takes a change end-to-end: branch from up-to-date `main`, write the code **plus tests**, review locally, open a PR, review it, and merge only if it's safe — then watch `main`'s CI and clean up. |
| **`review-pr`** | Reviews a pull request (human or bot) against this repo's constraints and returns a `SAFE TO MERGE` / `NOT SAFE` verdict with concrete blockers. |
| **`dependabot`** | Triages open Dependabot PRs, merging what passes review and commenting on what doesn't. |
| **`test-data`** | Creates isolated, throwaway data in a temp `DATA_DIR` for tests or manual runs — the safe alternative to ever touching the real `data/`. |

A typical flow: **`create-issue`** to capture the work → **`pick-issue`** to
choose what's next → **`implement`** to ship it (it calls `review-pr` before
merging). For dependency bumps, **`dependabot`** handles the batch.

### Doing it by hand

If you'd rather not drive Claude Code, the same expectations apply:

- Branch off an up-to-date `main` (never commit on `main`); use a descriptive
  name like `feat/session-export` or `fix/vote-tie`.
- Add or update tests for testable changes, and add any new user-facing string
  to **both** `public/js/lang/en.js` and `de.js` (key parity is enforced by a
  test).
- Make `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run check:syntax` all pass before
  opening a PR.
- Update `README.md` in the same PR when the change adds/renames a user-facing
  feature, alters the file tree above, or changes routes, scripts, or env vars.

## Data & backup

Everything lives in the `data/` folder (`data.json` + `uploads/`) — copy it to
back up, delete it to reset. The whole folder is git-ignored so your group's
data is never committed.

## About this project

This project was **developed entirely by Claude** (Anthropic's AI models,
via Claude Code), through an interactive, conversational process: a human described the
desired features and gave feedback, and Claude designed and wrote all of the
code, comments, and documentation. It stands as a small example of what
agentic, AI-assisted development can produce end to end.

Note the distinction from the "runs entirely on your machine" point above: the
app's *development* was AI-driven, but the app itself contains no AI and sends
no data anywhere when you run it.
