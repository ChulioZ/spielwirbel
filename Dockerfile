# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Production container for Spieleabend — a small, host-agnostic runtime configured
# entirely via env (PORT, DATA_DIR, DATABASE_URL, S3_*, AUTH_*, …; see .env.example).
# TLS is NOT handled here: it terminates at the reverse proxy / platform in front
# of this container (set TRUST_PROXY there so the rate limiter keys on the real
# client IP) — see issue #156. Persistence and uploads live on a mounted /data
# volume unless DATABASE_URL / S3_BUCKET point them elsewhere.

# Both stages pin an EXACT patch, not the floating `node:22-slim`: a floating tag
# reaches production only if the builder happens to re-pull it, so a Node security
# release may or may not arrive, silently. 22.23.2 (2026-07-28) fixed 11 CVEs,
# among them CVE-2026-58044 — HTTP header truncation, a request-smuggling
# primitive sitting in front of the per-IP rate limiters. Dependabot's `docker`
# ecosystem bumps this as a reviewable, CI-tested PR instead.
# See .claude/rules/pin-images-and-actions-by-digest.md.

# ---- build stage: install all deps and produce the content-hashed assets ----
# The optional cache-busting build (`npm run build`, issue #141) mirrors public/
# into dist/ with hashed, minified JS/CSS, so a production deploy serves
# self-invalidating assets. It needs the devDependency esbuild, which stays in this
# throwaway stage and never reaches the final image.
